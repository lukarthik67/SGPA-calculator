A simple SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) calculator built using Python. It uses functions, if-else conditions, and for loops to calculate SGPA based on user input of grades and credits.<br>
       # Algorithm <br>
step 1: input user name.<br>
step 2: input user USN.<br>
step 3: input number of sujects user have.<br>

step 5: In  each iteration of for loop ,get input of each subject marks and credits of that subjects.<br>
step 6: use condition statement to fetch particular earned points in particular subjects.<br>
step 7: while running for loop ,calculate total earned credits and total credits.<br>
